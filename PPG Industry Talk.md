# PPG Industry Talk - Reflection
Date: 20 Nov 2025

As a first-year Computer Science student, attending the PPG industry talk was a very eye-opening experience for me. Before this session, I honestly didn’t know much about PPG or what they actually do. I was surprised to learn that PPG is a global coatings company, and that their products are everywhere around us—from buildings, cars, electronics, airplanes, all the way to even food cans. Knowing that the company has more than 140 years of history also made me realise how stable and established it is.

What I found most interesting was how important technology is in PPG’s work. Even though they are known for paints and coatings, the speakers showed us that IT plays a huge role in helping the company run globally. I learned about different IT teams such as Data Analytics, Cloud Infrastructure, and SAP COE. Each team works on very large-scale systems that support the whole company across many countries. From the Data Analytics sharing, I realised how powerful data can be in making business decisions. The examples, like predicting risks for ships and analysing raw material supply problems, helped me understand that real-world data is much messier and more complex than what we learn in class. It also made me see how important SQL, data modeling, and dashboards are.

The Cloud team also showed how PPG uses many modern technologies like Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle Cloud, and even Alibaba Cloud. I never knew a coatings company would use so many different cloud platforms. Hearing about infrastructure-as-code, monitoring tools, and 24/7 operations made me realise how huge and critical IT infrastructure is in a global company. The SAP part was also very informative. I finally understood how big systems like SAP help connect different business areas such as purchasing, production, sales, and finance. It made me appreciate how important integrated systems are in large organisations.

Overall, this talk helped me understand how broad the IT field is, and how many different career paths are possible. Not only software development, but also data engineering, cloud management, ERP systems, cybersecurity, and more. It also motivated me to improve my skills, especially in SQL, cloud knowledge, and problem-solving. One thing I really liked was how PPG emphasized growth, mentorship, and opportunities for interns. Knowing that many interns were offered full-time roles, and that they get to work on global projects, made me feel excited about the possibility of joining such a company in the future.

In conclusion, the PPG industry talk was very inspiring and helped me see how what I learn in university can be applied in a real company. It also encouraged me to explore more areas in IT and to prepare myself better for future internships.
