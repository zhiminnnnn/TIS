## 🔎Project Overview
"Re-Saji" is an innovative smartphone application conceptualized to address an evergreen problem related to food waste in UTM cafeterias. By not relying on "guesswork" while food preparation, this system utilizes real-time data and AI to analyze and educate students to eat responsibly.
## 💡Design Thinking Process
This project used a comprehensive 5-step process of Design Thinking:
- **Empathize**: Conducted interviews and surveys to know the problem areas for both students and cafeteria staff, resulting in over 45 responses.
- **Define**:Identified the problem in its basic form, stating that food wastage comes about because of the absence of proper consumption forecasting.
- **Ideate**: Brainstormed ideas included smart bins, AI image recognition, but eventually, the decision landed on the QR reserve app.
- **Prototype**: Developed low-fidelity UI design prototypes with Canva. Designed the user journey for both students and kitchen staff.
- **Test**: Conducted testing of the prototype on UTM students and staff, who positively responded to its uses in forecasting student enrolment and minimizing wastage.
## 🛠️Technical Skills & Tools
- **Design Tools**: Canva (UI/UX Prototyping).
- **Technologies**: AI Image Recognition (for waste analysis), AI-based Prediction Models (for demand forecasting).
- **Methodology**: Design Thinking, User Research & Data-Driven Decision Making

## 💭Reflection
>This project was experienced as a highly beneficial and entertaining exercise. Eyes were opened to the fact that technology exists beyond coding and is focused on the resolution of daily issues and problems encountered in life. As food waste in cafeterias is viewed as a significant problem at UTM, the project was considered highly relevant.
>
>One key takeaway was learned: users must be thought of first and foremost. It was determined that food waste is not only planned inefficiently by cafeteria staff but is also caused by varying student schedules and eating times; these findings were reached after surveys and interviews were conducted with students to investigate the causes of waste.
>
>Methods for effective collaboration with others were also learned. Self-confidence was increased through idea-sharing, the receipt of constructive feedback, and the optimization of the solution as a group. Through the development of the Re-Saji application, it was realized how data concepts and basic AI concepts can be applied to make a tangible difference.
>
>In the future, the enhancement of knowledge in Python, SQL, and data analysis is desired. Furthermore, participation in more projects and hackathons is intended so that experience may be acquired and the knowledge of how optimal real-world solutions are provided may be gained.
