## Project Overview
"Re-Saji" is an innovative smartphone application conceptualized to address an evergreen problem related to food waste in UTM cafeterias. By not relying on "guesswork" while food preparation, this system utilizes real-time data and AI to analyze and educate students to eat responsibly.
## Design Thinking Process
This project used a comprehensive 5-step process of Design Thinking:
- **Empathize**: Conducted interviews and surveys to know the problem areas for both students and cafeteria staff, resulting in over 45 responses.
- **Define**:Identified the problem in its basic form, stating that food wastage comes about because of the absence of proper consumption forecasting.
- **Ideate**: Brainstormed ideas included smart bins, AI image recognition, but eventually, the decision landed on the QR reserve app.
- **Prototype**: Developed low-fidelity UI design prototypes with Canva. Designed the user journey for both students and kitchen staff.
- **Test**: Conducted testing of the prototype on UTM students and staff, who positively responded to its uses in forecasting student enrolment and minimizing wastage.
## Technical Skills & Tools
- **Design Tools**: Canva (UI/UX Prototyping).
- **Technologies**: AI Image Recognition (for waste analysis), AI-based Prediction Models (for demand forecasting).
- **Methodology**: Design Thinking, User Research & Data-Driven Decision Making

## Reflection
>_This Design Thinking project was, in fact, a very beneficial and entertaining exercise for me. It opened my eyes to the fact that technology exists beyond coding and focuses on solving issues and problems on a daily basis, which people encounter in their lives. Since food waste in cafeterias is a significant problem at UTM, this project was very relevant to me._
>
>_One key takeaway I learned is to think first and foremost about the user. I determined that not only is it inefficiently planned out by the cafeteria staff, but it is also due to varying student schedules and eating times when I surveyed and conducted interviews with students to see why they waste food in the cafeteria._
>
>_I also learned how to collaborate effectively with other people. Idea-sharing, receiving constructive feedback, and optimizing our solution as a group helped me increase in self-confidence. The development of the Re-Saji application helped me realize how data concepts, as well as basic AI concepts, can be applied to make a difference._
>
>_In the future, I would like to enhance knowledge of Python, SQL, and data analysis. In addition, I intend to participate in more projects and hackathons to acquire experience as well as the knowledge of how to provide optimal real-world solutions._
