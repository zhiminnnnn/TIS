## Reflection
>_This Design Thinking project was, in fact, a very beneficial and entertaining exercise for me. It opened my eyes to the fact that technology exists beyond coding and focuses on solving issues and problems on a daily basis, which people encounter in their lives. Since food waste in cafeterias is a significant problem at UTM, this project was very relevant to me._
>
>_One key takeaway I learned is to think first and foremost about the user. I determined that not only is it inefficiently planned out by the cafeteria staff, but it is also due to varying student schedules and eating times when I surveyed and conducted interviews with students to see why they waste food in the cafeteria._
>
>_I also learned how to collaborate effectively with other people. Idea-sharing, receiving constructive feedback, and optimizing our solution as a group helped me increase in self-confidence. The development of the Re-Saji application helped me realize how data concepts, as well as basic AI concepts, can be applied to make a difference._
>
>_In the future, I would like to enhance knowledge of Python, SQL, and data analysis. In addition, I intend to participate in more projects and hackathons to acquire experience as well as the knowledge of how to provide optimal real-world solutions._
