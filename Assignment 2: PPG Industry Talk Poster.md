## Reflection
> _From this talk, I learned how technology plays a role in PPG. IT teams such as Data Analytics and Cloud Infrastructure and SAP COE, support many countries' systems. The Data Analytics team showed me that real-world data could be so complex and that knowing SQL and data modeling and how to make a dashboard is so crucial. Cloud's talk was about the platforms they use in providing the service, including Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle, and Alibaba Cloud. They also talked about such things as infrastructure-as-code and the monitor tools._
>
> _The SAP segment was very interesting because it related to how the integrated systems link various areas of business. It is evident from the SAP segment that technology plays a crucial role in determining the success of a MNC. The team handling the SAP segment attempted to ensure that everyone knows the significance of interlinking various areas of business._
>
> _The talk opened my eyes entirely to other types of work I could be doing within the IT industry, other than developing software, such as data engineering, cloud management, ERP, and cyber security. It encouraged me to try and become more proficient in skills such as SQL, cloud, and problem-solving. I liked the way PPG considers the concepts of growth, mentorship, and offering global projects for interns. It excited me entirely for the work I could potentially be doing in the future with the likes of PPG, who consider the concepts of growth, mentorship, and offering global projects for interns._
>
>_In conclusion, the talk was really inspiring and showed me how I can apply the things that I'm learning at university at a real company. Also, it motivated me to research more into the areas of information technology and prepare myself for the next internships that I will apply._
