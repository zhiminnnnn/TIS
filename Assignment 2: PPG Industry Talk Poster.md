## Reflection
> _From this talk, I learned how technology plays a role in PPG. The IT teams, such as Data Analytics and Cloud Infrastructure and SAP COE, they all help with systems in many countries. Data Analytics team showed me how complicated the data from the real world can be and how important it is to know SQL and data modeling and how to make dashboards. The Cloud team talk about the platforms they use like Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle, and Alibaba Cloud. They also talked about things like infrastructure-as-code and the monitor tools._
>
> _The SAP segment was really interesting because it showed how integrated systems connect different business areas. The SAP segment made it clear that technology is a part of what makes a global company successful. The people in charge of the SAP segment wanted to make sure everyone understands how important it is for all the different business areas to be connected and working together._
>
> _The talk really opened my eyes to all the jobs I can have in the IT field not just making software, like data engineering, cloud managements, ERP, and cybersecurity. This made me want to get better at skills like SQL, cloud technologies, and problem-solving. I liked how PPG focuses on growth, mentorship, and global project opportunities for interns. This got me really excited about what I might be able to do in the future with companies like PPG that focus on growth, mentorship, and global project opportunities for interns._
>
> _In conclusion, the PPG industry talk was very inspiring and helped me see how what I learn in university can be applied in a real company. It also encouraged me to explore more areas in IT and to prepare myself better for future internships._
