## Reflection
> _The talk was very informative regarding the use of technology in PPG. The use of IT by the Data Analytics team, Cloud Infrastructure team, as well as the SAP COE team, helps support various systems in several different countries. The talk in the Data Analytics part was informative regarding the nature of data in real-world scenarios. The Cloud Infrastructure part of the talk was informative about the kind of clouds being utilized to deliver services._
>
> _The information presented by the SAP segment was very valuable with regards to understanding how an overall system can connect different aspects of business. This segment highlighted the important role that technology plays with regards to the overall success of a MNC. The group discussed the need for connecting different aspects of business._
>
> _The talk also explained that the scope of IT is much more than software development: data engineering, cloud management, ERP, and cybersecurity. The importance of gaining expertise in important skills, like SQL, cloud, and problem-solving, was emphasized. Furthermore, growth instigated by PPG, especially mentorship or global projects for interns, is exemplary in professional development and hands-on experience in shaping career readiness._
>
>_It was a really captivating talk that showed how knowledge gained within the university setting can be applied in a real business environment. In addition, this served as a great push for further interest in sections of information technologies and future preparations for internships within the industry._
