## Reflection
> _This is an important talk because it totally changed the way I think about my course work. I realized that it is not only important to program, but it is also important to understand the system and the planning process involved. This is because the speaker was very knowledgeable and had the ability to communicate in a way that is easily understandable. He used examples, for instance, preparing meals or registering into an institution when talking about System Development Life Cycle. This was appealing because it highlighted the fact that the process is basically the same as the activities we undertake in our daily lives._
>
> _I also learned about the Waterfall process and the Agile process. The Waterfall process is quite simple. It remains the same and does not change much. The Agile process, on the other hand, is quite flexible. Perhaps that is the reason why people use the Agile process for the work that will not be done using the Waterfall process because the requirement keeps changing._
>
> _Another thing that I thought was quite interesting is team working. We will be working among others in this industry, and we will have to communicate effectively among the group. The process of communicating is highly essential in our case as we will be working as a team for the project. The speaker also discussed AI tools like ChatGPT. We should be helped by AI tools. They should not replace our knowledge. Overall, this session has motivated me to pay more attention to learning the basics and preparing myself for the future._
