## Reflection
>The importance of the course was viewed in a new light following this highly significant talk. It was highlighted that programming proficiency must be balanced with an equal understanding of systems and planning processes. This message was effectively delivered through a presentation by an expert possessing strong communication skills. To explain the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), practical examples, such as food preparation or institutional enrollment, were utilized, allowing similarities between everyday tasks and system processes to be observed.
>
>Insights into various development methodologies, specifically the Waterfall and Agile processes, were provided during the session. The Waterfall process was described as linear and rigid, following a fixed pattern, whereas the Agile process was characterized as adaptable and flexible. Consequently, the frequent application of Agile in projects with evolving requirements was noted.
>
>Furthermore, a strong emphasis was placed on teamwork. The importance of effective group communication was highlighted, as industrial projects are considered collaborative efforts. Additionally, while the use of AI tools like ChatGPT is encouraged, it was mentioned that such technologies should be used to support learning and productivity rather than to replace foundational knowledge. In summary, the mastery of basic concepts, the understanding of system processes, and the development of communication and teamwork skills were reinforced, providing sufficient motivation for future professional preparation.
