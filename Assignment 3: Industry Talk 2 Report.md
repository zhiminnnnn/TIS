## Reflection
> This industry talk really changed how I think about my course. I learned that planning and understanding the system are just as important as coding. The speaker was really good at explaining things in a way. He used examples like cooking and enrolling into university to explain System Development Life Cycle. I liked this because it made me see that system development is actually a lot like the things we do every day. We need to plan, do the work, check the results, then improve, which is what System Development Life Cycle is about.
>
> I also learned about the Waterfall method and the Agile method. The Waterfall method is pretty straightforward. It does not change much. On the hand the Agile method is flexible. This is why people like to use the Agile method for projects where the Waterfall method will not work because the project requirements change a lot.
>
> Another thing that I found interesting was the idea of working in a team. We will be working with others in the industry so we need to be able to communicate with each other. The communication process is very important when we are working on a project as a team.
>
> The speaker also talked about AI tools like ChatGPT. AI tools should assist us. They should not replace our understanding. Overall, this talk motivated me to focus more on learning the basics and preparing myself better for the future.
