## Reflection
> _This talk was extremely important in that it changed the way of viewing the importance of this course. It was highlighted that not only is programming important, but knowledge about systems and planning processes is equally important. Presentation by expert with strong communication skills played an important part in this. Very practical examples like cooking food or enrolling in an institution were used to explain the System Development Life Cycle with similarities to these everyday tasks._
>
> _The session also gave an insight into different development methodologies, namely, the Waterfall and Agile processes. The Waterfall process was explained to be linear and somewhat rigid, always following the same pattern, while the Agile process is adaptable and flexible; hence, it has been finding a great deal of application in those projects where requirements keep changing with time._
>
> _Further, the session emphasized teamwork. It was highlighted that effective communication in a group is important since industrial projects are collaborative efforts. Also, he mentioned that though AI tools-ChatGPT-is very much welcome, technologies must be used to support learning and productivity, not to replace the foundation of knowledge. In summary, the session again pressed on the mastering of basic concepts, understanding of system processes, development of communication skills, and teamwork-all sufficient motivation to properly prepare for future professional life._
