## Reflection
>_The event was significant in learning in the sense that I was able to be exposed to the diverse areas that exist around quantum computing, in communication, education, and business. Such great participation of students, academics, and industry was evidence of progress in quantum technologies being collaborative and interdisciplinary. This shared interest simply reassured me that cooperation among sectors plays a big role in scientific progress._
>
>_It is clear from the welcome and keynote speeches that Malaysia is not only firm on enhancing its scientific development but also on widening international collaborations. Since it is in such a line, this has brought many thoughts on how students could have something to do with scientific advancements in general and current trends like quantum computing. The sense of national and global direction presented here was motivating and an inspiration for many._
>
>_In addition, the speeches given by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa and Mr. Ling Keok Tong were very informative on how Japan and Singapore are readjusting to live in a quantum enabled world. These speeches further enlightened me on the real-world implications of quantum computing and how it can help solve real-world problems. The exhibits were very informative because I was able to connect the theoretical information I learned with real-world applications that actually allowed me to engage with the information on a level that I can personally connect with._
>
>_The exhibition stands were also very important in reinforcing my knowledge of the area. They gave me a chance to be able to engage with current research, technological demonstrations, and innovative ideas associated with quantum computing. This engagement with the people presenting their ideas for research, technologies, and innovations in the exhibition stands gave me a chance to be able to pose questions and have a better understanding of how the ideas, which come from theoretical understanding, are applied. Therefore, the exhibition stands were critical in reinforcing my interest in the area as it relates to the application of quantum technologies in the advancement of future study._
