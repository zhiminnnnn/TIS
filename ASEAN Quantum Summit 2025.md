# Asean Quantum Summit 2025

Date: 11 Dec 2025

Venue: Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM

## Reflection
I was exposed to various themes such as quantum computing, communication, education, and business. It is very exciting to see that not only students and professors but also people from the industry are concerned with this particular event. From the opening speeches, I realized that Malaysia is serious about developing quantum science and collaborating with other countries. It made me feel very enthusiastic about the potential available to students in the future. The talks by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa and Mr. Ling Keok Tong allowed me to realize how Japan and Singapore are planning for the quantum future. I am amazed to learn how quantum computing can be used to tackle real-world problems. The exhibition booths are my favorite part because I managed to learn more from real projects and ideas.
