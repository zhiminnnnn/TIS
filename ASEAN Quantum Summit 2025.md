Date: 11 Dec 2025

Venue: Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM

## Reflection
>I learned about lots of things like quantum computing, communication, education, and business. It is really cool that students and professors and people who work in these fields are all interested in this event. When I listened to the speeches at the beginning I understood that Malaysia really wants to get better at science and work with other countries. This made me feel very excited about what students, like me might be able to do in the future with quantum computing and other things. The talks by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa and Mr. Ling Keok Tong allowed me to realize how Japan and Singapore are planning for the quantum future. I am amazed to learn how quantum computing can be used to tackle real-world problems. The exhibition booths are my favorite part because I managed to learn more from real projects and ideas.
