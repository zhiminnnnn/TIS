## Event Overview
The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 is convened on 11 December 2025 at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This event is going to be historic since this is the first ever ASEAN-level summit to be conducted on quantum science and technology. The programme is organized by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia with support from Malaysia Quantum Information Initiative.

It was able to convene participants from research, policy, industry, academia, and students both in ASEAN nations and other partner nations like Japan. The key agenda was to promote cooperation in the region, create awareness on quantum technologies, and share visions on the development of quantum research, education, and industry in ASEAN.
## Key Highlights
### 1. Opening Ceremony & Keynote Sessions
The conference kicked off with keynote speeches by renowned individuals in the industry, stressing that quantum technology represents an imperative area for future economic and security relevance and competitiveness. During this event, the need for cooperation among ASEAN nations in making progress in areas like quantum computing, quantum communications, and post-quantum cyberspace security could be noted.
The talks also stressed the need for:
- Strong government support and policy frameworks
- Investment in quantum education and workforce development
- Cross-border research collaborations
### 2. Panel Discussions & Knowledge Sharing
There were a number of panel discussions organized, where experts from academia and the industry were brought together. These sessions offered excellent insight into:
- Current challenges in quantum research
- The gap between theoretical research and real-world applications
- Opportunities for startups and industry participation

An important learning was that quantum technology is in its early development stage and that this is the most important time for ASEAN member states to prioritize investing in human and physical capital.
### 3. Exhibitions & Demonstrations
The exhibition area itself highlighted quantum-related research projects, prototypes, and learning resources. The displays helped the participants, mainly students, understand some difficult concepts about quantum by giving proper visual and interactive examples. Apart from that, the exhibition of quantum technology applications regarding secure communication, optimization, and quantum computing was also shown.
## Reflection
>_The event was significant in learning in the sense that I was able to be exposed to the diverse areas that exist around quantum computing, in communication, education, and business. Such great participation of students, academics, and industry was evidence of progress in quantum technologies being collaborative and interdisciplinary. This shared interest simply reassured me that cooperation among sectors plays a big role in scientific progress._
>
>_It is clear from the welcome and keynote speeches that Malaysia is not only firm on enhancing its scientific development but also on widening international collaborations. Since it is in such a line, this has brought many thoughts on how students could have something to do with scientific advancements in general and current trends like quantum computing. The sense of national and global direction presented here was motivating and an inspiration for many._
>
>_In addition, the speeches given by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa and Mr. Ling Keok Tong were very informative on how Japan and Singapore are readjusting to live in a quantum enabled world. These speeches further enlightened me on the real-world implications of quantum computing and how it can help solve real-world problems. The exhibits were very informative because I was able to connect the theoretical information I learned with real-world applications that actually allowed me to engage with the information on a level that I can personally connect with._
>
>_The exhibition stands were also very important in reinforcing my knowledge of the area. They gave me a chance to be able to engage with current research, technological demonstrations, and innovative ideas associated with quantum computing. This engagement with the people presenting their ideas for research, technologies, and innovations in the exhibition stands gave me a chance to be able to pose questions and have a better understanding of how the ideas, which come from theoretical understanding, are applied. Therefore, the exhibition stands were critical in reinforcing my interest in the area as it relates to the application of quantum technologies in the advancement of future study._
