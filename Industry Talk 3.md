## 🍨The "Information Systems Behind Power BI" (Analogy)
The speaker used a "Making a Dessert" analogy to explain the complex technical infrastructure supporting Power BI:
- **Ingredients (Data)**: Includes Sales, Customer, and Order data.
- **Suppliers (Data Sources)**: Managed through systems like SQL Server, SAP, Oracle, and Databricks.
- **Logistics (Network**): Facilitated by the Internet, VPN, and LAN.
- **Freezer (Storage)**: Utilizing Databases and Data Warehouses within PPG.
- **Baking Appliances (Hardware)**: Supported by physical servers and cloud computing.
## ✍🏻Reflection
The industry talk delivered by Qaisara Rohzan on January 14, 2026, illustrated an important spectrum that interlinked data engineering models from a theoretical standpoint with its execution stage at a macro-industrial scale. It has been observed that this note offers a brief insight into major technological takeaways available from this seminar with a setting that features a rapidly changing data landscape.
### 1. Structural Analysis of Information Systems
“Information Systems Behind Power BI” was definitely one of the most valuable lessons learned. In regard to the explanation of the Information Life Cycles using an analogy to convey such an abstract concept of how the life cycle of the information itself works was particularly effective in illustrating the point of how to complete the tasks at hand. This was particularly relevant in illustrating the point of how the use of Business Intelligence software such as Power BI is no more than the interface to a much larger system. In the Corporate environment and at PPG in particular, the job of the data engineer is to ensure the integrity of the logistics and storage aspect of the information as it develops into the final view.
### 2. The Strategic Role of Governance and the Center of Excellence (COE)
The Power BI COE topic shifted the focus from development to the governance side of the issue from an organization level. Even in the world of academical project tasks, the data itself might be very static and regionalized, as mentioned earlier, yet the key take-away from the topic is the fact that in a global chemical company, the data itself has to be managed in a manner where “single source of truth” is ensured for the data itself. The fact that COE focuses on documenting the existing processes as well as new processes in the realm of working in new processes indicates that COE is firmly associated with the concept that scalability in data engineering is also associated with enabling and optimizing code.
### 3. Technological Evolution: Transitioning to Microsoft Fabric
This is a case study of the speaker’s employment as a Fabric Administrator and is a discussion on the growth in the industry as a whole toward a common data platform. Going forward from the traditional Power BI-related environments to the world of Microsoft Fabric is actually an indication of the industry moving toward ‘all-in-one’ solutions for Data Analytics stemming from Data Warehousing, Data Science and Data Engineering on a single platform. This view supports the reality of data professionals’ needs to be platform agnostic and flexible regarding SaaS models on the integration side of the cloud.
### 4. Professional Identity and Career Trajectory
What is even more commendable about the speaker’s experience is transitioning from being a Data Engineering student to a Senior Application Development Analyst in the span of merely two years. This not only validates the actuality of the requirement for specialized professionals in the area of data but also attests to the effectiveness of the internship program in view of its importance in churning out professionals.It is also a testament to the fact that knowledge of the business sector, in this instance coating and specialty materials, is crucial for focusing their technical expertise on the needs of the particular industry, for instance, analyzing optical products.
### Conclusion
This talk provided a whole systems take on what it really means to manage data on a big scale. It reinforced that data engineering is not simply a technical animal, but necessitates a knowledge of the tech stack, a dogmatic approach to data governance based on a Center of Excellence, as well as the farther reach to stay on top of new innovations such as Microsoft Fabric.
