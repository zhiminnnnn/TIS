- **Suppliers (Data Sources)**: Managed through systems like SQL Server, SAP, Oracle, and Databricks.
- **Logistics (Network**): Facilitated by the Internet, VPN, and LAN.
- **Freezer (Storage)**: Utilizing Databases and Data Warehouses within PPG.
- **Baking Appliances (Hardware)**: Supported by physical servers and cloud computing.
## ✍🏻Reflection
The interlinking of data engineering models from a theoretical standpoint with the execution stage at a macro-industrial scale was illustrated in the industry talk delivered by Qaisara Rohzan on January 14, 2026. It has been observed that a brief insight into major technological takeaways from this seminar is offered by this note, within a setting featuring a rapidly changing data landscape.
### 1. Structural Analysis of Information Systems
“Information Systems Behind Power BI” was definitely one of the most valuable lessons learned. In regard to the explanation of the Information Life Cycles using an analogy to convey such an abstract concept of how the life cycle of the information itself works was particularly effective in illustrating the point of how to complete the tasks at hand. This was particularly relevant in illustrating the point of how the use of Business Intelligence software such as Power BI is no more than the interface to a much larger system. In the Corporate environment and at PPG in particular, the job of the data engineer is to ensure the integrity of the logistics and storage aspect of the information as it develops into the final view.
### 2. The Strategic Role of Governance and the Center of Excellence (COE)
One of the most valuable lessons learned was provided by the section “Information Systems Behind Power BI.” The manner in which tasks are completed was effectively illustrated through the use of an analogy for Information Life Cycles, which was employed to convey the abstract concept of how the information life cycle functions.

The point that Business Intelligence software, such as Power BI, is utilized as nothing more than an interface to a much larger system was particularly highlighted. In the corporate environment, and specifically at PPG, the integrity of the logistics and storage aspects of information is ensured by the data engineer as that information is developed into the final view.
### 3. Technological Evolution: Transitioning to Microsoft Fabric
A case study of the speaker’s employment as a Fabric Administrator is presented, and the growth in the industry toward a common data platform is discussed. The industry’s movement toward “all-in-one” solutions for Data Analytics, stemming from Data Warehousing, Data Science, and Data Engineering on a single platform, is indicated by the transition from traditional Power BI-related environments to the world of Microsoft Fabric. The reality that data professionals are required to be platform-agnostic and flexible regarding SaaS models on the integration side of the cloud is supported by this view.
### 4. Professional Identity and Career Trajectory
What is even more commendable about the experience of the speaker is the transition made from a Data Engineering student to a Senior Application Development Analyst in the span of merely two years. The actuality of the requirement for specialized professionals in the area of data is not only validated, but the effectiveness of the internship program, in view of its importance in the production of professionals, is also attested to. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that knowledge of the business sector (in this instance, coatings and specialty materials) is crucially required so that technical expertise may be focused on the needs of a particular industry, such as the analysis of optical products.
### Conclusion
A whole-systems take on what is truly entailed in the management of data on a large scale was provided by this talk. It was reinforced that data engineering is not simply a technical entity; rather, it is necessitated that a knowledge of the tech stack be maintained, a dogmatic approach to data governance be adopted through a Center of Excellence, and a farther reach be established to remain abreast of new innovations such as Microsoft Fabric.
