# SECP Student Development Program 2025
`Date: 8 Nov 2025`
</div>

## Reflection
> _All SECP students from Year 1 to Year 3 are invited to attend this program. As a first-year CS student, it is really motivating because it helps me see the bigger picture of my university life._
>
> _In the morning talk, we had the privilege to listen to "The Attributes of UTM Graduates" conducted by Mr. Baharudin Mastari, the Senior Deputy Registrar of the Faculty of Computing in UTM. He told us what qualities the university expects in us by the time we graduate. Before that talk, all I cared at school was to pass my subjects well. But after the talk, I came to understand that what's even more important than having good academic achievement is to be a good leader, to be an effective communicator, and to be a person of high values._
>
> _The next session was a sharing by Ms. Noor Hazwani Ramli, a former PETRONAS executive who has been running GetMeHired since 2020. She shared that most companies use Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to scan, sort, and filter job applications, so it's important to know how to format my resume to be "ATS-friendly" in order to be properly parsed and ranked by the system. Basically, "content over graphics" is the key for writing effective resumes._
>
> _Last but not least, what I learn from seniors' advice is don't be afraid to join any available competitions, like Hackathon. I always thought I have to be "prepared" and know everything to be qualified to participate in competitions, but it's actually the other way round. We learn and gain new experience by joining competitions._
>
> _Now, I do have a greater sense of focus and motivation regarding my studies in Data Engineering. This is because I am eager to implement the knowledge gained, not just in the assignments but in designing the entire university experience._
