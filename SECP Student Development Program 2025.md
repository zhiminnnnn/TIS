# SECP Student Development Program 2025 - Reflection
Date: 8 Nov 2025

All SECP students from Year 1 to Year 3 are invited to attend this program. As a first-year CS student, it is really motivating because it helps me see the bigger picture of my university life.

In the morning session, we listened to a talk about "The Attributes of UTM Graduates" by speaker Mr. Baharudin Mastari, Senior Deputy Registrar for the Faculty of Computing at UTM. He explained what skills the university wants us to have by the time we graduate. Before this, I was just focused on passing my subjects. But after listening to the talk, I realized what matters the most is not just about getting good grades but also being a good leader, an effective communicator, and someone with strong ethics. So, I need to develop my soft skills over the next four years alongside my technical courses.

The next session was a sharing by Ms. Noor Hazwani Ramli, a former PETRONAS executive who has been running GetMeHired since 2020. She shared that most companies use Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to scan, sort, and filter job applications, so it's important to know how to format my resume to be "ATS-friendly" in order to be properly parsed and ranked by the system. Basically, "content over graphics" is the key for writing effective resumes.

Last but not least, what I learn from seniors' advice is don't be afraid to join any available competitions, like Hackathon. I always thought I have to be "prepared" and know everything to be qualified to participate in competitions, but it's actually the other way round. We learn and gain new experience by joining competitions.

Overall, I feel more focused and motivated about my studies in Data Engineering now. I'm excited to apply what I've learned, not just in my assignments, but in shaping my overall university experience.
