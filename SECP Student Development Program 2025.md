# SECP Student Development Program 2025
`Date: 8 Nov 2025`
</div>

## Reflection
>All SECP students from Year 1 to Year 3 are invited to attend this program. As a first-year CS student, a great deal of motivation is felt because the bigger picture of university life is helped to be seen.
>
>In the morning session, the privilege of listening to "The Attributes of UTM Graduates" was granted, which was conducted by Mr. Baharudin Mastari, the Senior Deputy Registrar of the Faculty of Computing. The qualities expected by the university upon graduation were described. Prior to that talk, focus was placed solely on passing subjects; however, it was subsequently understood that even more importance is placed on being a good leader, an effective communicator, and a person of high values than on academic achievement alone.
>
>The next session consisted of a sharing by Ms. Noor Hazwani Ramli, a former PETRONAS executive by whom GetMeHired has been operated since 2020. It was shared that Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by most companies to scan, sort, and filter job applications. Consequently, the importance of formatting a resume to be "ATS-friendly" was emphasized so that it may be properly parsed and ranked by the system. Essentially, "content over graphics" is highlighted as the key to writing effective resumes.
>
>Finally, from the advice given by seniors, it is learned that competitions such as Hackathons should not be feared. It was previously thought that one must be fully "prepared" and knowledgeable to be qualified for participation, but the opposite is shown to be true. New experience is gained and learning is achieved through the act of joining these competitions.
>
>A greater sense of focus and motivation regarding studies in Data Engineering is now possessed. This is driven by an eagerness to implement the knowledge gained, not only within assignments but in the design of the entire university experience.
