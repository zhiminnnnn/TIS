## Vision
A future where every member is supported by a strong, widespread network of genuine connections, unlocking personal and professional opportunities.

## Mission
To consistently improve our social skills and build a wide network of connections by stepping outside our comfort zones and communicating openly with others.

## Agreement
We agree to attend meetings and complete tasks on time, communicate respectfully, support each other, and cooperate fully to ensure the successful and timely completion of the project.

## Reflection
> _This is not only a field trip, but it is actually an immersion experience that has greatly aided in developing my knowledge for the learning course, Technology and Information System, and future career paths. We are taught in class the concepts of databases, networks, and software development. But in UTMDigital, I got to experience their working Data Center and how they manage their enterprise-grade servers and enterprise-grade security networks. I realized how they easily implement their concepts of cloud computing and cybersecurity to ensure the reliability of their digital services. Also, in the interview for their project of system building, we learned about the challenges they experience and how they can overcome these challenges in system building, as well as some tips for our future career path. Additionally, the planning for creating the video as a team is needed for this experience. The process of conducting the interview helped in developing our skills in communicating. Additionally, this experience has aided in developing our soft skills and team concept._
