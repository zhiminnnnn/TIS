## Vision
A future where every member is supported by a strong, widespread network of genuine connections, unlocking personal and professional opportunities.

## Mission
To consistently improve our social skills and build a wide network of connections by stepping outside our comfort zones and communicating openly with others.

## Agreement
We agree to attend meetings and complete tasks on time, communicate respectfully, support each other, and cooperate fully to ensure the successful and timely completion of the project.

## Reflection
>The field trip was regarded as more than a simple excursion, as an immersion activity was provided that greatly enhanced the understanding of the Technology and Information Systems course. Although concepts such as databases, networking, and software development had been presented within a classroom lecture setting, an insight into the real-world application of cloud computing and cybersecurity was allowed by the visit to UTMDigital. The relationship between these technologies and the reliability and security of a digital enterprise was clearly demonstrated.
>
>Furthermore, the challenges involved in system development and the approaches used to mitigate them were understood through the project-related interview. Matters concerning career development were also addressed during the discussion. Additionally, the significance of teamwork was realized through the collective process of learning and video creation. It is recognized that not only were technical aspects acquired through this immersion experience, but essential soft skills, such as collaboration, were also developed.
