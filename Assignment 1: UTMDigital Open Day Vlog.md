A future where every member is supported by a strong, widespread network of genuine connections, unlocking personal and professional opportunities.

## Mission
To consistently improve our social skills and build a wide network of connections by stepping outside our comfort zones and communicating openly with others.

## Agreement
We agree to attend meetings and complete tasks on time, communicate respectfully, support each other, and cooperate fully to ensure the successful and timely completion of the project.

## Reflection
>_This was more than a field trip, providing an immersion activity that greatly added understanding of the Technology and Information Systems class. While these concepts have been presented in the classroom lecture setting through the study of databases, networking, software development, amongst other concepts, the visit to UTMDigital allowed the individual an insight into the real-world application of cloud computing and cybersecurity concepts as it relates to the reliability and security of digital enterprise. It was noted that the visit was an immersion activity that greatly added understanding._
>
>_Moreover, the interview related to the project allowed one to understand the challenges involved in the system development and the approaches used to deal with them. Moreover, the issue related to career development has been dealt with in the discussion. Moreover, learning and creating a video together has allowed one to understand the significance of working in teams. It is recognized that this immersion experience has allowed one to learn not just technical aspects but also important soft skills like collaboration._
