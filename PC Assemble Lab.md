## Reflection
>Methods for working in groups and the procedures for assembling and disassembling a PC were taught in this particular class. The most important lesson gained was how theories could be connected to practice. While learning is normally derived from textbooks and internet videos regarding the various parts of a system unit, an enlightening experience was provided by the opportunity for hands-on learning.
>
>Furthermore, difficulties were encountered in regard to cable management, as meticulousness was required and the instruction manual had to be consulted to ensure cables were attached to the correct pinholes of the motherboard. Nonetheless, a very special experience was gained, and gratitude is extended to Dr. Aryati for the provision of this unique learning opportunity.
