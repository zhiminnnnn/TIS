## Reflection
>_This particular class taught us how to work in groups and how to put and take apart a PC. The most important thing I learned from this class was how to connect the theories to practices. Normally, we always learn from our textbooks and from videos found on the Internet about the different parts of a system unit, but to be able to learn from it hands-on was really an enlightening experience. Moreover, I found this quite difficult with regards to managing cables since we need to be very meticulous and refer to our instruction manual to be able to attach the cables to the right pinholes of the motherboard. Nonetheless, this was a very special kind of experience, and I would like to thank Dr. Aryati very much for giving us this very unique opportunity to learn._
